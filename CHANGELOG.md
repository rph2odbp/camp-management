- **Environment:** Successfully configured the Nix-based development environment (`.idx/dev.nix`) for reproducible builds.
- **Firebase Project:** Initialized the Firebase project, including Authentication, Firestore, Storage, and Cloud Functions.
- **Connection & Security:** Systematically diagnosed and resolved complex issues related to:
    - API Key restrictions and HTTP referrer policies.
    - Cloud Firestore & Storage API enablement.
    - Firebase Authentication provider settings (including Email Enumeration Protection).
    - Firestore database provisioning.
    - IAM and organizational policies.
- **Dependency Management:** Installed and configured all necessary frontend and backend libraries (e.g., Express, CORS, Chart.js, Google Generative AI).

#### **2. Admin Portal**

- **Session Management:** Implemented UI for creating and managing camp sessions.
- **Cabin Management:** Created a comprehensive tool for creating cabins and assigning campers and staff.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Developed a dashboard with key metrics:
    - Visual charts for session enrollment and camper gender distribution.

#### **3. Parent Portal**
- **Camper Registration:** Built a user-friendly, multi-step form for registering new campers, including basic info, medical details, and file uploads.

    - Created a dedicated, secure portal for users with the `medical` role.
    - Built a dashboard to search and view all campers.
    - Implemented a detailed medical record view with tabs for medical overviews, document management (upload/delete), and a comprehensive event chart.
    - Integrated charting forms (e.g., `HospitalVisitForm`) into the medical workflow.

#### **5. Bug Fixes & Refinements**

### Future Work & Detailed Roadmap

The following is a detailed outline of the features and tasks remaining to complete the project as envisioned.

#### **1. Complete the Hiring & Employment Section**
- **Staff Application Form:** Create a public-facing form for prospective staff to apply for jobs (`EmployeeApplicationForm.js`). This will include fields for personal info, experience, and resume/document uploads.
- **Application Management Panel:** Build a new tab in the Admin Portal to review submitted applications.
    - View applicant details and attached documents.
    - Add internal notes and track applicant status (e.g., "Pending," "Interviewing," "Hired").
    - Add a button to "Hire" an applicant, which would trigger the `createUser` function to create a staff user account for them.

#### **2. Enhance the KChat Assistant**
- **Add More Tools:** Expand the AI's capabilities by creating new functions for it to call, such as:
    - `listStaffByCabin(cabinName)`
    - `getUpcomingSessionDates()`
    - `findCamperByName(camperName)`
    - `summarizeMedicalNotes(camperId)`
- **Improve Context:** Enhance the chat history management to provide the AI with better context for follow-up questions.

#### **3. Finalize Payment Integration (Helcim)**
- **Configuration:** Replace placeholder API tokens in the backend with your real Helcim credentials.
- **API Validation:** Thoroughly test the `/hosted-pages` request against the Helcim API documentation to ensure all required fields are present.
- **Webhook Setup:** Deploy the backend and configure the webhook URL in your Helcim merchant dashboard to ensure purchases are fulfilled correctly.
- **Testing:** Perform end-to-end tests of the purchase flow with Helcim's test card numbers.

#### **4. Refine Reporting & Analytics**
- **Date Range Filters:** Add filters to the reporting dashboard to allow admins to view data for specific time periods.
- **Data Export:** Implement a feature to export report data to CSV or PDF format.
- **New Reports:** Create additional reports, such as:
    - Cabin roster summaries.
    - Staff assignment lists.
    - Financial reports based on message package purchases.

#### **5. General Polish & User Experience**
- **UI Consistency:** Perform a full review of the application to ensure a consistent look and feel across all portals.
- **Loading & Error States:** Improve loading spinners and provide more user-friendly error messages throughout the app.
- **Password Reset:** Implement a "Forgot Password" flow using Firebase Authentication's built-in functionality.
- **Testing & QA:** Conduct thorough testing of all features and user roles to identify and fix any remaining bugs.
