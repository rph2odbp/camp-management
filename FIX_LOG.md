# Environment Build Error and Fix Log

## Problem Description

The development environment was consistently failing to build, showing the following error:

```
warning: $HOME ('/home/user') is not owned by you, falling back to the one defined in the 'passwd' file ('/root')
error: â€¦ while calling the 'derivationStrict' builtin
```

This error prevented the workspace from starting, despite multiple rebuild attempts.

## Root Cause Analysis

The error originated from the Nix package for `firebase-tools` (`pkgs.firebase-tools`). The build process for this specific package has dependencies or scripts that conflict with the user and home directory setup within the Firebase Studio environment, leading to the ownership error.

## Solution Implemented

To permanently resolve this issue, the installation method for `firebase-tools` was changed.

1.  **Removed Nix Package:** The line `pkgs.firebase-tools` was removed from the `packages` list in the `.idx/dev.nix` file. This stopped Nix from managing the installation.

2.  **Installed via npm:** `firebase-tools` is now installed globally using `npm` during the workspace creation phase. The `onCreate` hook in `.idx/dev.nix` was updated as follows:

    ```nix
    # .idx/dev.nix
    
    ...
      workspace = {
        # Runs when a workspace is first created
        onCreate = {
          # Install firebase-tools globally via npm to avoid Nix build issues
          install-firebase-and-npm-packages = "npm install -g firebase-tools && npm install && npm install --prefix backend && npm install --prefix frontend";
        };
    ...
    ```

This change bypasses the problematic Nix build process and uses a standard, more reliable method for installing this Node.js-based tool, ensuring the environment builds successfully.
