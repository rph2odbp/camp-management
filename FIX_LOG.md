# Session Restart Log

## User Frustration

The user has expressed extreme frustration after attempting to rebuild the environment over 30 times without success. They are feeling exhausted and on the verge of giving up.

## Issue

The development environment was failing to build due to an error in the `.idx/dev.nix` file. The error message was: `The option 'idx.previews.previews.emulator-ui.port' does not exist`.

## Actions Taken

1.  **Identified the root cause:** The error was traced back to an invalid `port` attribute within the `emulator-ui` preview configuration in the `.idx/dev.nix` file.
2.  **Corrected `.idx/dev.nix`:**
    *   Removed the invalid `port` attribute from the `emulator-ui` preview.
    *   Modified the `web-app` preview to use the standard `$PORT` environment variable for port assignment.
3.  **Conducted a full configuration review:**
    *   Examined `firebase.json` for correct emulator and hosting settings.
    *   Reviewed `package.json` files (root, frontend, and backend) for dependency and script issues.
    *   Validated the syntax of `firestore.rules`.
4.  **Communicated the fix:** Explained the changes made to the user and confirmed that the rest of the configuration appears to be in order.

## Next Steps

The user has been advised to reload the environment. If the issue persists, this log will provide context for the next troubleshooting steps.
