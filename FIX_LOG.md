# FIX: Session List Not Loading on Homepage

**Date:** 2024-07-25

## Problem Description

After a restart of the Firebase Studio environment, the homepage failed to display the list of available camper sessions. The application would compile, but the session list section remained blank. Browser developer tools indicated a `NetworkError` when trying to fetch the `bundle.js.map` source map, and a subsequent build error pointed to a syntax issue in `frontend/src/SessionList.js`.

## Root Cause Analysis

The investigation revealed two distinct but related issues:

1.  **Missing Data Fetching Logic:** The primary problem was that the data fetching logic within the `useEffect` hook in `frontend/src/SessionList.js` had been removed. The component was rendering without making any calls to the Firestore database to retrieve session and camper information.

2.  **Syntax Error:** In the process of restoring the data fetching logic, a minor syntax error was introduced. A single, extraneous period (`.`) was added after the opening curly brace of an arrow function (`renderSessionItem`), causing the React development server's build process to fail.

## Solution

The issue was resolved by taking the following steps:

1.  **Restored Data Fetching:** The `useEffect` hook in `frontend/src/SessionList.js` was repopulated with the correct Firestore `onSnapshot` listeners. This re-established the real-time connection to the `sessions` and `campers` collections, ensuring the component received the necessary data.

2.  **Corrected Syntax Error:** The typo in the `renderSessionItem` function was identified and removed.

With these fixes, the application built successfully, and the `SessionList` component now correctly fetches and displays the session data as intended.
