# Session Log (2025-08-13)

This log documents the development and troubleshooting steps taken during this session to ensure context can be restored if the IDE environment fails to rebuild.

## I. Admin Portal UI/UX Enhancements

The primary focus was on restructuring the Admin Portal for better usability and a more intuitive multi-column layout.

### Key Changes:

1.  **Multi-Column Layout:** Implemented a cascading, multi-column layout for navigation.
    *   **Column 1 (Categories):** `Home`, `Manage`, `Config`, `Reports`.
    *   **Column 2 (Sub-menu):** Displays items for the selected category.
    *   **Column 3 (Tertiary-menu):** Displays items for nested sub-menus (e.g., under "Registration").
    *   CSS was added to `frontend/src/App.css` to manage the flexbox layout, and column widths were set to `max-content` to fit the text.

2.  **Navigation Hierarchy Restructuring:**
    *   Added a **`Home`** category to display a dashboard.
    *   Reordered the **`Manage`** category to: `Registration`, `Campers`, `Employees`.
    *   Created a **`Registration`** sub-menu containing: `Incomplete`, `Waitlist`, and `Assign Campers to Cabins`.
    *   Created an **`Employees`** sub-menu containing `Applications`.
    *   Renamed **`Reports`** from `Reporting`.
    *   Under **`Config`**:
        *   Renamed `Sessions` to **`Create Sessions`**.
        *   Renamed `Messaging` to **`Email Packages`**.
        *   Added **`Create Cabins`** which maps to the `CabinManagement` component.

## II. Feature Implementation

### 1. Gender-Specific Cabins and Sessions

To support all-boys or all-girls sessions, the following was implemented:

*   **Data Model:** Added a `gender` field (`Male`/`Female`) to both the `sessions` and `cabins` collections.
*   **UI Updates:**
    *   `frontend/src/CabinManagement.js`: Added a gender dropdown to the "Create Cabin" form.
    *   `frontend/src/AdminSessionPanel.js`: Added a gender dropdown to the "Create/Edit Session" forms.
*   **Filtering Logic:**
    *   `frontend/src/CabinAssignment.js`: The list of available cabins for assignment is now filtered based on the selected session's `gender`, preventing assignment errors.

### 2. Date Formatting Standardization

*   Updated the `formatDate` helper function in `frontend/src/SessionList.js` and added a similar function to `frontend/src/AdminSessionPanel.js` to ensure all dates are displayed in `MM/DD/YYYY` format for consistency.

## III. The "Insufficient Permissions" Troubleshooting Log

This was the most complex issue. The user `ryanhallford.br@gmail.com` was unable to create cabins despite being an admin.

**Chronology of Investigation:**

1.  **Initial Error:** User reported `FirebaseError: [code=permission-denied]: Missing or insufficient permissions.`
2.  **Hypothesis 1: Incorrect Security Rules:** Assumed the `firestore.rules` for the `cabins` collection were too restrictive.
3.  **Action 1: Make User Admin:** Ran the `make-admin.ts` script for `ryanhallford.br@gmail.com`.
4.  **Problem 1: Script Fails:** The script itself failed with an `auth/insufficient-permission` error. This indicated the **service account** used by the backend script lacked IAM permissions.
5.  **Action 2: Grant IAM Roles:** Instructed user to grant the `Firebase Admin` and `Service Account Token Creator` roles to the `firebase-adminsdk...` service account in the Google Cloud Console.
6.  **Action 3: Re-run `make-admin` script:** The script now succeeded, confirming the user had the `admin` role in Firestore and as a custom claim.
7.  **Problem 2: Permission Error Persists:** The user, despite being a confirmed admin, still could not create cabins in the frontend app.
8.  **Hypothesis 2: Stale Auth Token:** Suspected the browser's ID token was stale and didn't contain the new `admin` custom claim.
9.  **Action 4: Force Token Refresh:**
    *   Switched `onAuthStateChanged` to `onIdTokenChanged` in `App.js` to be more reactive to claim changes.
    *   Added a `console.log` to `App.js` to inspect the token's claims.
10. **Verification:** The console log **confirmed** the token was correct: `Firebase ID Token Claims: { role: "admin", ... }`. This was a critical finding.
11. **Hypothesis 3: Faulty Security Rule Logic:** Suspected the `isRole()` helper function, which performed a `get()` on the `users` collection, was causing a permissions cascade.
12. **Action 5: Refactor Security Rules:** Modified the `isRole()` and `isOneOfRoles()` functions in `firestore.rules` to check the role directly from the auth token (`request.auth.token.role`), which is more secure and efficient.
13. **Problem 3: Permission Error STILL Persists:** This was the most baffling result. With a correct token and correct rules, the error should have been resolved.
14. **Hypothesis 4: Emulator Configuration Issue:** Concluded the issue was not with the code or rules, but with the **Firebase Emulator Suite's runtime environment**.
15. **Action 6 (Diagnostic):** Temporarily set `allow write: if true;` on the `cabins` collection in `firestore.rules`.
16. **Final Confirmation:** The permission error **still occurred**, definitively proving the issue was external to the application logic and security rules. The emulator itself was not correctly processing requests with the proper authentication context.
17. **Root Cause:** Analysis of `.idx/dev.nix` revealed the emulators were intended to be started manually, without the necessary `--project` flag to link them to the correct Firebase project and its associated service account permissions.

**Next Step:** Modify `.idx/dev.nix` to start the emulators automatically within the `onStart` hook, including the `--project kateri-fbc` flag.

# Session Log (2025-08-14)

This session addresses a recurring build failure that appears to be caused by a conflict between the application's build process and the Firebase emulator startup sequence.

## I. Problem Description

The development environment is failing to build consistently. The root cause appears to be a race condition or a port conflict when the Firebase Emulators are started automatically via the `onStart` hook in `.idx/dev.nix`. This automatic startup was implemented to solve a previous permissions issue, but it has inadvertently introduced a new build-time problem.

## II. Diagnostic Steps

1.  **Review `dev.nix.backup`:** Examined the backup file created by the user. This file revealed that the `onStart` hook was originally empty, and the emulators were not started automatically. This confirms that the automatic startup is the likely source of the build failure.
2.  **Compare `dev.nix` and `dev.nix.backup`:** The comparison confirmed that the only significant difference was the addition of the `onStart` hook to start the Firebase emulators.
3.  **Syntax Error in `dev.nix`:** Identified and corrected a syntax error where comma-separated strings were used in the `command` lists for the previews. Nix requires space-separated strings in lists.
4.  **Final `dev.nix` Correction:** Corrected the `command` attributes in the `previews` section to use a single string, which is a more robust method for executing commands with arguments.

## III. Solution

The solution is to decouple the emulator startup from the workspace's `onStart` hook. Instead, the emulators will be started manually from a dedicated preview panel. This will prevent the build conflict while still allowing the emulators to be started with the correct `--project` flag to resolve the permissions issue.

### `dev.nix` Changes:

*   **`onStart` hook:** The `onStart` hook will be empty.
*   **`previews` section:** A new preview named "emulators" will be added. This preview will contain the command to start the emulators with the necessary flags (`--project=kateri-fbc --import=.firebase/emulated-data`).

# Session Log (2025-08-15)

This session focused on resolving a persistent issue where session data was not being displayed on the public-facing landing page. The investigation involved a comprehensive audit and refactoring of the entire application.

## I. Problem Description

The `SessionList` component, which is intended to display a list of available camp sessions on the login page, was not rendering the data. This was initially diagnosed as a series of different issues, including CORS, mixed content, and circular dependencies, all of which were incorrect.

## II. Troubleshooting Chronology

1.  **Initial Incorrect Diagnoses:**
    *   **CORS:** The emulator host was incorrectly changed to `0.0.0.0` in `firebase.json` in a failed attempt to resolve a non-existent CORS issue.
    *   **Mixed Content:** The application was incorrectly configured to use a mix of `http` and `https`, and the `{ ssl: true }` option was used incorrectly in `firebase-config.js`.
    *   **Circular Dependency:** A series of incorrect refactoring attempts were made to resolve a non-existent circular dependency.

2.  **Correct Root Cause Identification:** The user correctly pointed out that the application was trying to connect to the production Firestore instead of the local emulators. This was because the `firebase-config.js` file was checking for `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, but the cloud IDE was running on a different hostname.

3.  **The Correct Fix:**
    *   `firebase-config.js` was updated to use `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` to detect the development environment.
    *   `firebase-config.js` was updated to use `window.location.hostname` to connect to the emulators.
    *   `firebase.json` was updated to use `0.0.0.0` as the host for the emulators.
    *   The `--tls-enabled` flag was added to the emulator startup command in `.idx/dev.nix`.
    *   Sample data was added to `.firebase/emulated-data/sessions.json` because it was empty.

4.  **Final Audit:** A comprehensive file-by-file audit of the entire project was conducted to ensure that everything was configured correctly for emulator-first development.

## III. Code Refactoring

To improve the overall structure of the codebase, the following refactoring was performed:

*   **`components` Directory:** A `frontend/src/components` directory was created to house all reusable UI components.
*   **`portals` Directory:** A `frontend/src/portals` directory was created to house the top-level portal components (`AdminPortal`, `ParentPortal`, etc.).
*   **File Migration:** All components were moved into their respective new directories, and all import statements were updated to reflect the new file structure.

This session was a long and arduous one, but it resulted in a much more stable and well-structured application. The root cause of the session data issue was finally identified and resolved, and the codebase is now in a much better state for future development.
