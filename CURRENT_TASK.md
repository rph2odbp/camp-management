# Current Task: Resolve Firebase Emulator Port Issues

**Problem:**

We are unable to start the Firebase Emulators because the default ports they require (4000, 4400, 5000, 5001, 8080, 9099, 9199) are not being exposed by the development environment. This results in "port taken" or "could not start" errors.

**Solution:**

We have modified the `.idx/dev.nix` file to explicitly define and expose all the necessary ports for the Firebase Emulator Suite.

**Next Step:**

The user needs to reload the environment for the changes in `.idx/dev.nix` to take effect. After reloading, the `firebase emulators:start` command should succeed, and we will be able to view the application and the emulator UI.
