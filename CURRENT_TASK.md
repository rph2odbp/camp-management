## Current Task: Admin Portal

The current task is to build out the Admin Portal. This will involve creating the following components:

*   `AdminPortal.js`: The main entry point for the Admin Portal.
*   `UserManagement.js`: A component to manage user roles.
*   `SessionManagement.js`: A component to create, edit, and delete camp sessions.
*   `Reporting.js`: A component to generate reports on camp data.

I will start by creating the `AdminPortal.js` component.
